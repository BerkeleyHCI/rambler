    1: "I think having colored pencils and paints is also helpful for adding more color to your sketches, but I know it's not always feasible. Like if you're on the go. For me, it's pretty funny because I used to start off by drawing a lot from my own ideas. And I think during the pandemic, I started doing sort of these art pieces that were very informed by my state of mind. And in a way, I express that through poetry. And so, I started writing my thoughts down first and then coming up with a vision to represent it. But I think, like I think every process is individual to the artist.",

Interestingly, I've shifted from drawing from my own ideas to creating art reflecting my mental state during the pandemic. I express this through poetry, writing my thoughts before visualizing them. However, I believe each artist's process is unique.",

    1: "There are probably like common ways that people do things or go about getting inspiration. Like, for example, looking at nature, exploring the world, looking at Pinterest, or like other photos people have taken. But, I think honestly, there's no right way to do art, because oftentimes, art is one of those few things where you are trying to express your own take or express something that means something to you. Or it's something that has a meaning that you find important. But, the one thing that is a caveat, is that you are essentially trying to express yourself, but also in a way, like your audience will put their own interpretation or project their own interpretation onto your piece of art as well. So, it's definitely like a two-way sort of interaction, despite no one being there. And despite the parties not being there in person, necessarily. I think it is different from other things. I think it is different from consumer-based products or product design or other sort of projects where there is an intent for the creator to cater to the audience. In this case, art, I think is different because it does not require the artist to cater, it more so is an expression of the artist. And perhaps the hope of communicating something that is similar in a similar vein to the audience. Then again, this is just my perspective.",
    2: "Art is a unique form of expression that doesn't necessarily follow common inspiration methods like observing nature or browsing Pinterest. It's a personal endeavor, aiming to convey something meaningful to the artist. However, it's also a two-way interaction, as the audience interprets and projects their own understanding onto the artwork. Unlike consumer products or product design, art doesn't require the artist to cater to the audience. Instead, it's about expressing oneself and hopefully communicating something similar to the viewers. This perspective emphasizes the individuality and interpretive nature of art.",
